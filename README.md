# About Me
Hello! I'm Sarah! I'm a self-taught python programmer and love using this language to perform analytics. I have several years of professional analytics experience and enjoy developing new, creative ways to use data to drive decision making. This skill set is beneficial for many industries and positions (even beyond analytic positions). Please feel to browse some of the sample projects I've developed for personal use.

## Sample Projects
<details>
<summary><b>Chord Diagrams</b></summary>
<p>
Here's an example of a chord diagram which is a type of advanced text analytics visualization. It is a helpful tool that can highlight patterns and associations in a given type of text. It can be used in many different types of applications. The picture below visualizes the text from an article about the Super Mario movie. The chart is interactive in it's html format.

<summary><b>Geo-Analytics</b></summary>

<p>
Here's an example of a map plot I made using hypothetical data to show user age by location. The circles on the chart show where participants are located by city. The size of the circle represents the amount of people in that city. The bigger the circle the more people. The color of the circle shows average participant age ranging from 20 - 70 (blue - yellow, respectively). Similarly to the above example, this chart is interactive in it's html format.

<summary><b> Resturant Dashboard </b></summary>
<p>
Have you ever been indecisive on what you want to eat? Or maybe, you know you want to try a new resturant but aren't sure what to try. I built a two part dashboard to address these problems.
</p>

<b>Part 1: Scraping all pages of yelp based on a type of resturant </b>
<br>
To be added soon!
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 2: Detailed analytics of a specific resturant</b>
<br>
To be added soon!
